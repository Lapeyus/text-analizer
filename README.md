This code imports the `pyttsx3` and `PyPDF2` libraries, initializes a text-to-speech engine using `pyttsx3`, creates a list of texts to be converted to speech, saves the speech output to an mp3 file named "d.mp3" using the `save_to_file()` method, and then says "hello" using the `say()` method.

However, there is a mistake in this code. The `save_to_file()` method should be called after the `say()` method. Also, the `runAndWait()` method needs to be called after both `save_to_file()` and `say()` methods in order for the program to run correctly. 

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
import pyttsx3
import PyPDF2

speaker = pyttsx3.init()

texts = ["This is an example of text-to-speech conversion", "Hello World"]
for text in texts:
    speaker.say(text)
    speaker.runAndWait()

speaker.save_to_file("Hello", "d.mp3")
```

This code will iterate over each text in the `texts` list, say it out loud using the `say()` method, and then save the speech output to an mp3 file named "d.mp3" using the `save_to_file()` method. Finally, it will say "Hello" and exit.
